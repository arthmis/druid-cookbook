# Updating Data on Button Click 

You've successfully lensed into your application data, however, whenever the data is modified through a textbox, it is instantly updated. You only want to update the data after the user has clicked a button, `Save`. To accomplish we will use the `Scope` widget. 

```rust
{{#include lens_updating_data.rs}}
```
